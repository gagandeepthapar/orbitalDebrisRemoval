# **AERO - 351 Final Project**
**Orbital Mechanics:** Hypotehtical orbital debris rendezvous demonstration using propulsive maneuvers.

## **Background**
AERO-351, or Orbital Mechanics, is a class taught at the California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly SLO) which serves as an introduction to...
> "[The] Motion of a body in a central field. Keplerian Orbits. Orbital Manuevers. Interplanetary trajectories." - Cal Poly Aerospace Engineering Course Catalog

The final project in the course was a group effort to select 4 pieces of orbital debris from an online catalog (with at least 1 debris being in each LEO, MEO, or GEO), rendezvous with each debris piece, and determine the Delta-V required to complete the mission. No specific constraints were given as the final project was a demonstration of the material taught in the course, however, orbital perturbations for each of the debris must be accounted for before determining the rendezvous location and Delta-V required.

The repository contains the MATLAB files for the project and associated figures.

## **LEO Debris (#1): Iridium-33 Debris**

## **LEO Debris (#2): Iridium-33 Debris**

## **MEO Debris: GLONAS Rocket Body**

## **GEO Debris: INTELSAT 2-F2**

## **Orbital Manuevers**
